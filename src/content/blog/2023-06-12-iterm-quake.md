Recently my work computer switched from a Windows box to a MacBook Pro, which reminded me of this feature in iTerm (I had been using this feature on Console2 on Windows): The Quake Terminal controlled by Alt + `.  
   
In iTerm preferences:  
1. Under **Keys**, select **Hotkey**
2. Press to *Create a Dedicated Hotkey Window...`
3. Set the Hotkey to Opt + `
4. Configure it to only "Animate showing and hiding"
  
After that iTerm creates a Hotkey Window profile that is assigned to the iTerm pane that drops from top of the screen each time.   
  
To make this work well with multiple screens, select the *Hotkey Window* profile, and under the **Window** tab, pick "Screen with Cursor" for the Screen picker.
