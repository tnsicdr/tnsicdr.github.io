Very recently, I came across a cool widget on another developer's blog (don't quite remember who's blog, since I was more excited about the widget and dove in there instead) that added support for comments on static sites by leveraging GitHub Discussions. Behold: [giscus](https://giscus.app).  
  
It's a brilliant concept, especially for blogs hosted on GitHub Pages (especially in public repos): both the content and the comments can be stored in a single place.
