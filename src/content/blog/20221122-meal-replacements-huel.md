_Disclaimer: I am not well educated in food and diet, I am a programmer, not a nutritionist. I recommend doing your own research before opting to use meal replacements._  
  
Over the last month, I've been supplementing my meals during my professional life with [Huel](https://huel.com/), a meal replacement that includes a meal's worth of calories and nutrition packed in a easily consumable drink. My typical choice of meal replacement is a competing product, [Soylent](https://soylent.com/), but I came into contact with Huel from instagram advertisements, as well as my cousin having previously been a user of the product.  
  
Unlike Soylent, Huel has a gritty texture to it, but the flavor is a world's difference. Compared to Soylent Powder in its original flavor, the original flavor of Huel is quite appetizing, and without an "artificial" feel or aftertaste. When I had been consuming powdered Soylent on the regular, it was out of a desire to expedite my meals, rather than for flavor or nutrition, so Huel was a pleasant surprise. While Soylent will always hold a special place in my gut as my first exposure to meal replacements, I think Huel will be my powdered choice going forward. It'll probably be the product I recommend to others as well- while I still enjoy Soylent ready-to-drink bottles, they are admittedly, an acquired taste.
